# addressmatch
VBA program to query an external database and match/correct errors in submitted addresses

This program will take a submitted address and send it to a geocoding service for processing. It will then convert the returned code into a standard format and replace any errors in the original address. Finally it will save the census tract where the submitted address is located.
